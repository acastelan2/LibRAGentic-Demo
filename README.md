Welcome to the LibRAGentic Demo!

This is a helpful AI bot that analyzes novel reviews written by the general public. Currently, only Reddit and Goodreads.com reviews are supported

To use this app, prompt the AI with questions/statements structured similar to the following formats:

* What does [Reddit/Goodreads] think about "X" book?
* What is the overall sentiment of "X" from [Reddit/Goodreads]?
* Summarize the [praises/criticisms] about "X" from [Reddit/Goodreads]
* Highlight some [positive/negative] reviews about "X" from [Reddit/Goodreads]

Note that:
- You can simultaneously request reviews from both sites (replace the '/' with 'and')
- You can request specific subreddit searches, e.g., "What does r/books think about "X" book?"

Future plans:
* Implement additional website support
* Analyze discussions of the reviews
* Book recommendations
* Book summaries?
